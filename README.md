# Telecom Domain 5G Launch Data Analysis Dashboard
Analyzing the dataset of a telecom company to track it's important KPIs, compare post and pre 5G launch performance and performing market competition analysis to provide insights to the executives in the telecom domain using Power BI.

## Problem Statement
AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.

## Task

- Create the metrics according to the metrics list.

- The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
